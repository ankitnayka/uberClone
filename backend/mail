 Assistance Required for Enabling Free Access to JavaScript Maps API  

Dear Google Support Team,  

I hope you are doing well. I am trying to access the **JavaScript Maps API** for free, but I am unable to enable the API on my Google Cloud project. Despite following the setup process, I am either encountering errors or not seeing the expected activation.  

Could you please assist me in enabling the API? Additionally, I would appreciate any guidance on using the free tier and ensuring that I do not incur unexpected charges.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,
